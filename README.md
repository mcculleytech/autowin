# Overview
This repository holds the boxstarter configuration for windows installs. I'm tired of manually installing and configuring windows VMs specifically so I'm working to automate those deployments. 

## Improvements/notes
- Look to the commando vm project to see what additional tools could be installed.
- Should I disable defender entirely?
- Include XML configurations for further customizations
